Woo[DEM]
============

Woo is extensible and portable framework primarily for mechanics granular materials using the [Discrete Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_element_method). Computation parts are written in c++ parallelized using OpenMP, fully accessible and modifiable from python (ipython console or scripts). Arbitrarily complex scenes can be scripted. Qt-based user interface is provided, featuring flexible OpenGL display, inspection of all objects and runtime modification. Parametric preprocessors can be written in pure python, and batch system can be used to drive parametric studies. New material models and particle shapes can be added (in c++) without modifying existing classes. Woo is a commercially-backed and geared towards customisations for non-trivial, challenging scenarios â€” sieving, segregation, conveyors, membranes and similar.

Woo is used in academic sphere, in the industry, runs in Linux and Windows, and on clusters. Examples of what Woo can do are at https://woodem.org/gallery/ .

The https://ask.woodem.org forum provides help in using Woo, on the basis of open-source kindness and collaboration; commercial help and customizations are available from https://woodem.eu.
